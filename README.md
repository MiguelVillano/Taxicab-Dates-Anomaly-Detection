# Taxicab Anomaly Detection

This project applies statistical and machine learning techniques to detect anomalous taxi trips based on trip characteristics such as distance, duration, and fare behavior.

## Overview
Taxi trip data are explored, cleaned, and analyzed to identify unusual patterns that may indicate errors, fraud, or atypical ride behavior.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Feature scaling  
- Anomaly detection through Z Scores and Tukey's Fences  
- Visualization of outliers  

## Key Findings
- Most trips follow consistent relationships between distance, time, and fare.  
- A small subset of trips display abnormal patterns and are flagged as anomalies.  

## Tools
Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
